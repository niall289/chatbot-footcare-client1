## Integration Methods

### Simple iframe Embed
For basic integration, a simple iframe can be used to embed the chatbot:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-hosted-chatbot-url.com/chat" 
  style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; width: 350px; height: 500px; border: none; z-index: 9999; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 5px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.16);" 
  id="footcare-chatbot">
</iframe>
```

### JavaScript Widget (Recommended)
For a more professional solution, the JavaScript widget provides better integration:

```html
<script>
  (function(w,d,s,o,f,js,fjs){
    w['FootCareWidget']=o;w[o]=w[o]||function(){(w[o].q=w[o].q||[]).push(arguments)};
    js=d.createElement(s),fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    js.id=o;js.src=f;js.async=1;fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);
  }(window,document,'script','fcChat','https://your-hosted-chatbot-url.com/widget.js'));
  fcChat('init', { 
    botName: 'Fiona',
    clinicLocation: 'all',
    allowImageUpload: true,
    theme: 'teal'
  });
</script>
```

## Testing the Integration

You can test the chatbot widget locally by accessing:
```
http://localhost:5000/example-embed.html
```

This example page shows the widget embedded in a sample website layout.

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. **Hosting:** Host the widget.js file on the same domain as the chatbot to avoid CORS issues
2. **Performance:** The widget is designed to load asynchronously to minimize impact on page load
3. **Security:** The widget uses secure localStorage for state management
4. **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes are included
